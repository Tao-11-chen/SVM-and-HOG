# SVM
Try SVM to do OCR(classify number from 0~9)

## 1.install dependences:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## 2.Noticed that it is an effect display of SVM using the SVM code included in the OpenCv library
this repo **does not** containes the source code of SVM.


## 3.Containes the source code of HOG feature extraction algorithm and an extra perceptron's code.
  - uses HOG to extracte vector to input to the SVM
  - perceptron.py is an extra part.
